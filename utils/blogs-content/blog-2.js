        "Learning a foreign language is no child's play, or is it? As it seems, children don't struggle as badly as us when they take on a challenge to learn a new language. Ever wonder why? The reason is a lack of fear. They don't fear mistakes, and neither do they shy away from testing their skills in real-time. Fortunately, you can power up your language-learning journey too. All you need to do is adopt the right strategy and get started.",

For example, the English language has about 600,000 to 1 million words; learning them all is out of the question. In contrast, all you need to do is learn the 'right' words. Sticking with the English language, learning the top 100 words give you the proficiency to read 50 percent of its text, while those who know about 1000 words can call themselves proficient.",
